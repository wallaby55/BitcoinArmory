Contributing to Armory can be done through submitting code via Pull Requests, reviewing code, and submitting bug reports.

### Contribute and Review code

Fork the the source code, typically the [dev branch](https://github.com/goatpig/BitcoinArmory/tree/dev), to a topic branch in your own repo. Write your patch and then submit a Pull Request. The code will be reviewed by other developers and the merged in by the project lead.

To review code, simply choose a Pull Request to review and read over the changes made by the PR. Leave comments if there is anything that you think should be different.

### Report bugs

The project utilizes the issue tracker feature of github. If you find a bug in the software, submit a new issue to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/goatpig/BitcoinArmory/issues). Be sure to include the Armory logfile and replication instructions. If necessary, include Bitcoin Core's debug.log file.
